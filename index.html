    <h3 class="articlesubtitle"> The Approach </h3>
    <p class="articletext">We started early, thankful the road was clear up to the trailhead. Last time
    we attempted this climb we had to hike up the snow covered road which took far longer than anyone
    anticipated. We ended up quitting seven miles in after realizing there was no way we could summit seven
    after starting at four in the morning. This time however the weather seemed to be on our side, anticipated
    in the cold morning air we stuffed our gear into our packs, choked down a few energy bars, and set out.
    The approach itself is a long valley which twists right and then sharply left. All around are verical cliffs
    lined with steep couliors filled with snow. in the deep winter the ridge to the nortwest is a dangerous
    avalanche hazard, but in the spring the snow settles and the way up becomes much more stable. It took us
    three hours to travers the four mile valley to where the proper ascent began, and by the time we did so,
    the sun was up and the temperatire was rapidly increasing. </p>

      <h3 class="articlesubtitle">The Conditions<h3>
      <p class="articletext">Interesting thing about climbing in spring. There is a weather phenomenon known as
        an inversion, where the higher up you climb, the warmer it gets. You see, while snow appears shiny and
        reflective, if you look at it in the IR spectrum, it is almost perfectly black. Snow absorbs heat like
        nothing else, and it radiates it into the air nearby. Thus, the high mountains are a veritable incubator
        and as the hot air rises, the slope can rise to 60-70 degrees where the weather 2000' down in the shady
        valley can be 30. This rapid warming creates dangerous destabilization effects in the snowpack and This
        is what we encountered when Nick lost both his skis and basically fell down the face of the mountain.
        Moral of the story; start early!</p>
